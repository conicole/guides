# Marionette Guides

Have you ever wanted to be a puppet master? Now, through the power of
JavaScript, you can pull the strings and make your applications dance! This
book will take you through the journey from Punch and Judy to Master of Puppets.

This book is a comprehensive guide to all aspects of the Backbone and Marionette
frameworks for JavaScript. From the basics of installing and setting up your
first JavaScript app to developing a complex full-featured application that can
integrate with multiple web services, navigate your user through your systems
from any arbitrary entry point, and take full advantage of the latest JavaScript
and HTML5 features.


## What is Marionette?

Marionette is a flexible web app framework that helps you build your apps
quickly and integrated into any of your web service backends easily.

Marionette is built on the popular [Backbone.js][backbone] framework - with a
major upgrade of the View layer of the MVC/MVVM application design pattern. In
essence, Marionette gives you a set of simple, yet powerful, components for
building your web applications that handle the, sometimes messy, business of
rendering your data and handling user and server input on your application and
data.


### Marionette Version

This Guide covers version 2.4 of Marionette. Since this guide was published,
Marionette 3 has been released with some major improvements. We would recommend
you use the newer versions where possible. This guide will continue to cover
version 2 and we will link to a separate guide covering version 3 when it
becomes available.
